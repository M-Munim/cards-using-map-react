        name: "1. Half-Life: Alyx",
        release: "March 23, 2020",
        desc: "Valve’s first Half-Life game in 13 years reminded us of the signature innovation that’s made this series so special, and why its return was so anticipated. Just as the first Half-Life proved you could tell a compelling story in a first-person game without taking control of the camera away, and Half-Life 2 pioneered physics-based puzzles and combat, Half-Life: Alyx set a new standard for polish in virtual reality shooters and is a truly unique experience. It's so impressive, in fact, that we believe fully justifies investing in a VR headset for your PC if you haven't already (especially now that a Meta Quest 2 can be had for $300 and connects to your PC wirelessly via Air Link)."

        release: " October 26, 2018",
        desc: "Arthur Morgan’s sprawling tale of loyalty, conviction, and the price of infamy is only the beginning of Red Dead Redemption 2. The marvelous PC port overhauled and further enhanced the gorgeous wild western atmosphere of Rockstar's most recent open-world adventure and added even more activities, unlockables, and impossibly fine details to its expansive map. It's possibly one of the biggest and best single-player PC games ever and it has an extensive multiplayer mode too.  Red Dead 2 cracked the top five on our updated list of the best open-world games. In just four years, it's also earned a spot on the list of best-selling video games of all time."

        name: "3. Grand Theft Auto 5 / GTA Online",
        release: "April 4, 2015",
        desc: "Grand Theft Auto V’s sprawling, yet meticulously detailed map is still the high bar to which most open-world games aspire. Not only is it huge, it’s incredibly dense with excellent content – not just the driving and shooting and three-protagonist story that make up its campaign, and not limited to the numerous side activities, but all the sights, sounds, and bustling activity you'd expect to find in a city teeming with humans, seedy underbelly included. With so much to do, explore, and play with, both as a single-player PC game and Grand Theft Auto Online, plus great creative tools and mods, it’s truly amazing on multiple levels."

        release: "November 5, 2021 ",
        desc: "Driving games are a long-running, important, and respected force in the story of video games, but it takes a special one to completely seize the imaginations of both the car-obsessed and the automotively illiterate so successfully. By that measure, Forza Horizon 5 is truly special. A slick and speedy smorgasbord of total driving freedom built on the back of what’s already been the open-world racing series to beat for nearly a decade, Forza Horizon 5 broke through in a way not even its excellent predecessors managed."

        release: "September 17, 2012",
        desc: "No game simulates the feeling of being in command of a starship flying by the seat of your pants like FTL: Faster Than Light. It's a game you shouldn't expect to survive – more likely, you'll be blasted out of the sky by a vastly superior enemy ship or boarded by a death squad of giant killer insects who massacre your crew. Maybe your life-support system will be hacked and everyone will suffocate.And every so often, you might even win. We also named FTL one of the best roguelike games."

        name: "6. Final Fantasy XIV Online",
        release: "August 27, 2013",
        desc: "In short, Final Fantasy XIV is not just the best MMO you can play right now, it’s a fantastic Final Fantasy game in its own right. Through its relaunch and subsequent four expansions, FFXIV has slowly morphed from a relatively generic good-versus-evil plot into a sprawling, political, and fantastical thriller. The latest expansion, Endwalker, brings a satisfying conclusion to the game’s now 8+ year storyline, returning some familiar faces, settling old scores, and of course saving the world from the greatest calamity yet."
